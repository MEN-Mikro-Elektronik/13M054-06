Overview of all Programs
------------------------

m54_simp         - M54 example for simple motor movement
m54_binin        - M54 example for binary inputs
m54_binout       - M54 example for binary outputs
m54_simpsig      - M54 example for simple motor movement with signals

Program m54_simp
----------------

Usage:
   m54_simp <device> <chan>

Function:
   M54 example for simple motor movement

Options:
   device       device name   
   
Description:
   Simple example program for the M54 driver   
   
   Performs a simple motor movement without using interrupts/signals.   
   Move from the current position 400000 pulses forward.   
   During movement, all indications of the LM628 are displayed.   
   
   Uses hardcoded PID control, velocity and acceleration parameters    
   that should be adapted for the actual motor in use.   
   
   This program does not use the binary inputs, outputs and the line break   
   and glitch detection of the M54.   
   
Program m54_binin
-----------------

Usage:
   m54_binin <device>

Function:
   M54 example for binary inputs

Options:
   device       device name   
   
Description:
   Example program for binary inputs of the M54 driver    
   
   This program continously prints the state of the binary inputs. It also   
   installs interrupts/signals for some of them.   
   
Program m54_binout
------------------

Usage:
   m54_binout <device>

Function:
   M54 example for binary outputs

Options:
   device       device name   
   
Description:
   Example program for binary outputs of the M54 driver    
   
   This simple example program stimulates the binary outputs of the M54   
   
Program m54_simpsig
-------------------

Usage:
   m54_simpsig <device> <chan>

Function:
   M54 example for simple motor movement with signals

Options:
   device       device name   
   
Description:
   Simple example program for the M54 driver using signals   
   
   Performs a simple motor movement using interrupts/signals.   
   Move from the current position 400000 pulses forward.   
   
   For trajectory complete, positioning error and line break events,    
   an interrupt/signal is installed.   
   
   Uses hardcoded PID control, velocity and acceleration parameters    
   that should be adapted for the actual motor in use.   
   
   This program does not use the binary inputs, outputs and the    
   glitch detection of the M54.
